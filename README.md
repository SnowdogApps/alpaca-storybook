## Cooperation with Storefront UI

Ideas behind Alpaca UI and [Storefront UI](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/) are common efforts. We share almost identical configuration and API so you can easily switch between these two ones. We joined forces in figuring out how to make things right to deliver best possible experience to the users.
